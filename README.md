# VS Code Theme Editor

A desktop application for creating, editing, and managing VS Code themes with deduplication and intelligent color palette tracking.

---

## üéØ What It Solves

VS Code themes contain hundreds of color scopes that often reuse the same colors. Without intelligent deduplication:

- ‚ùå Edit "red" in 50 places separately
- ‚ùå Inconsistent color values across the theme
- ‚ùå Difficult to track where colors are used
- ‚ùå Manual updates required everywhere

**This app solves it** by treating colors as first-class objects with automatic scope tracking and O(1) lookups.
